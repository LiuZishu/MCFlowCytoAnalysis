Introduction of  data sets
1. abundance.txt: relative cells abundance per subcommunity per sample
#Explination for each colunm
#"Sample_name": name of samples;
#"Group": reactors where samples picked from;
#"Time_d": sampling time (day)
#"G1-68": subcommunities

2. abio.txt:abiotic parameters
#Explination for each colunm
#"Group": reactors where samples picked from;
#"Time": sampling time (day)
# Abiotic parameters, such as "Tmp": temperature; "pH":pH; "EC": electric conductivity; "NH4": ammonium concertration;...

3. All.txt:relative cells abundance per subcommunity and corresponding abiotic parameters
All=read.table("All.txt",header=T,sep="\t")

4. TestRefSpace.txt:the test result of whether reference space was built per reactor
EcoSat=read.table("TestRefSpace.txt",header=T)

5. and 6. According to reactor groups, D(q=0) of dominant subcommunities were divided into two files:"diversity.txt" for controls; "diversityDs.txt" for disturbed reactors.

7. te.txt: Temperature data for disturbed reactors (D1,D2 and D3)
